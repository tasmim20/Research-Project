     # Single Edge Node Consideration:

    The environment, MobileEdgeComputingEnv, simulates a scenario where a single edge node is available. The state represents the load on this single edge node (i.e., how busy or free it is). The load level of this edge node is represented by 5 different states (from 0 to 4).

#Single Mobile Device:

    The environment MobileEdgeComputingEnv is designed such that a single mobile device interacts with an edge node by either offloading tasks to the edge node or processing them locally on the device itself.
    There is no explicit reference to multiple mobile devices in the code, and all actions, rewards, and decisions revolve around the interactions of a single agent (the mobile device).

#q-learning # Q-learning update rule
q_table[state, action] = q_table[state, action] + alpha _ (
reward + gamma _ np.max(q_table[next_state, :]) - q_table[state, action]
)

        Q-learning Update Formula:

This is the core of the Q-learning algorithm. It updates the Q-table based on the reward received from the environment and the agent’s estimate of future rewards.

    Old Value: q_table[state, action]: This is the current estimate of the value of taking the given action in the current state.
    Reward: reward: This is the immediate reward the agent received for taking the action.
    Future Value Estimate: np.max(q_table[next_state, :]): This is the agent's estimate of the best future reward it can obtain from the next state (after taking the action).
    Update Rule: The Q-value is updated to reflect both the immediate reward and the estimated future rewards using the formula:

Q(s,a)=Q(s,a)+α×(r+γ×max⁡(Q(s′,a′))−Q(s,a))Q(s,a)=Q(s,a)+α×(r+γ×max(Q(s′,a′))−Q(s,a))

Where:

    s is the current state.
    a is the action taken.
    s' is the next state.
    a' is the next action (the one that maximizes future rewards).
    r is the reward received.
    alpha (learning rate) controls how much the new information overrides the old.
    gamma (discount factor) controls how much future rewards influence the current update.

Average reward per test episode: 80.7

What This Means:

    Each row represents a state (how busy the edge node is).
    Each column shows the Q-value for either offloading or processing locally.

Let’s Look at It Row by Row:

    State 0 (Edge Node is Not Busy):
        80.58 for offloading the task.
        76.91 for processing locally.

    Explanation:
        The Q-value for offloading is higher (80.58), meaning the model learned that it's better to offload the task when the edge node is not busy.

    State 1 (Edge Node is a Little Busy):
        80.32 for offloading.
        77.08 for processing locally.

    Explanation:
        Offloading is still better in this case, but the values are closer, meaning there’s not as much benefit to offloading when the load increases a little.
